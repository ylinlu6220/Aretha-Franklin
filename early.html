                        Aretha was born in Memphis, Tennessee March 25th 1942. In her early years her family moved to both 
                        Buffalo, New York and Detroit, Michigan. Although she spent her time in other states like New York, 
                        it's said that she thought of Detroit as her hometown. Her mother died when she was only ten years old, 
                        so she was mostly raised and spent most of her later life with her father, who was a minister at a 
                        Baptist church. (he was also a civil rights activist, and a lot of people called him the man with the 
                        million - dollar voice)
                    </p>

                        He was the one who encouraged her to sing, and he would make sure she was seen when she sang in church. 
                        She also learned how to play the piano around this time without proper or formal lessons, and by the 
                        time she was 10, she saw her career as a gospel singer. However, at just 12 years old, she gave birth to 
                        her first son, Clarence, and another two years later named Edward. Although she was so young, this never 
                        stopped her in doing what she was interested in, as her older sisters and grandmother helped her take 
                        care of her two sons while she still pursued a career in music. At 14 years old, she had already 
                        released an album “Songs of Faith”.

                        As a teen, she would travel with her father on his speaking tours as a member in the junior choir. She 
                        befriended many other gospel singers along the way such as  Clara Ward and Mahalia Jackson. It's also 
                        said that on her trips with her dad, she came across Sam Cooke, who was a lead singer in a gospel group 
                        called the Soul Stirrers. Sam Cooke later left his career as a gospel singer, and transitioned to secular 
                        pop music, which interested Aretha, in which she considered a life diving into other types of music 
                        different from gospel as well. Now, at the time her father was her manager where they recorded for a local 
                        record label, however he thought that she could excel and go farther with a larger company. John Hammond, 
                        an executive producer invited her to New York for a live audition, and just like that, she then landed a 
                        contract with the most “prestigious of American record companies” at the ripe age of 18.
