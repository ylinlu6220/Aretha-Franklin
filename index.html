                        Aretha Franklin, revered as the Queen of Soul, was more than just an iconic singer and songwriter—she was
                         a civil rights activist whose outstanding vocal range resonated with people around the world, earning 
                         her a spot in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as its first female inductee. Twice acclaimed as the greatest 
                         singer of all time by Rolling Stone with global sales exceeding 75 million records, she indisputably 
                         stands as one of the world's best-selling music artists. But while her musical presence is widely 
                         regarded and still talked about today, Aretha Franklin's involvement and remarkable impact on the 
                         womens' rights and civil rights movement necessitates just as much recognition and discussion as her 
                         musical impact receives. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How exactly did she contribute to the fight for civil rights and women's rights? We see so much emphasis 
                        placed upon her musical career as the “Queen of Soul,” but her involvement in the civil rights and 
                        women's rights movements warrants a similar level of attention, too. And how did her most famous song, 
                        “Respect,” gain so much widespread fame and recognition—so much so, that it became an anthem representing 
                        the fight for equality for African Americans and women in America?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project aims to discuss Aretha Franklin in depth, starting with her childhood and life before she 
                        rose to stardom before detailing how she came into the person we all know today—the revolutionary singer, 
                        songwriter, and performer whose voice changed the world. With her talents, Franklin used her gift to lead 
                        and perform work as a civil rights activist, becoming a memorable icon for women's rights in the process. 
                        The main goal of this project is to inform others of her work and most notable accomplishments, as well 
                        as how her actions impacted our lives today. You'll find that her work also is directly related to topics 
                        discussed in class, which we hope to further our research on—and learn more about who the legendary 
                        Aretha Franklin was, too.
