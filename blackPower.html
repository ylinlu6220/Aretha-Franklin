                        Franklin was immersed in the civil rights movement for as long as she grew up with her father. She would 
                        express her support for the cause through multiple acts of service, such as providing funds for civil 
                        rights groups and performing at various protests. One of her most commendable acts during the civil 
                        rights movements was when she offered to post bail for Angela Davis, a prominent activist for civil 
                        rights who was jailed in 1970 after being accused of assisting in a courtroom siege that resulted in the 
                        deaths of four people and eluding the police.

                        At the time of her arrest, thousands of Americans across the nation began pushing for Davis' release from 
                        jail, attending rallies and protesting for her immediate release and freedom. Franklin also spoke up 
                        about Davis' imprisonment, declaring to the press that Davis deserves freedom, and that she would gladly 
                        pay for her bail, “whether it's $100,00 or $250,000.” While her father did not agree with her stance on 
                        the issue, Franklin told the press that although she still respects him and his ideals, she will 
                        nevertheless continue to stick to her beliefs and push for Davis' freedom.

                    <p>
                        “Angela Davis must go free. Black people will be free. I've been locked up (for disturbing the peace in 
                        Detroit) and I know you got to disturb the peace when you get no peace. Jail is hell to be in. I'm going 
                        to see her free if there is any justice in our courts, not because I believe in communism, but because 
                        she's a Black woman and she wants freedom for Black people. I have the money; I got it from Black 
                        people—they've made me financially able to have it—and I want to use it in ways that will help our people.”

                    <h2>The Meaning of “Respect”</h2>
                    <div class="img-2">

                    <p>
                        Franklin's unwavering dedication and support for the civil rights movement extended far beyond her acts 
                        of good service and contributions to the community. Indeed, it would be impossible to talk about Aretha 
                        Franklin's involvement in the civil rights movement without mentioning her rendition of “Respect,” which 
                        is considered one of the most iconic and influential hits of her music career. The song was first 
                        recorded in 1965 by Otis Redding, an American singer and songwriter. The original meaning of the song was 
                        about a hard-working man requesting “a little respect” from his lover once he returns home from work. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Franklin, who was around 25 at the time, would later come across the song in 1967 and decided to 
                        transform it into that of her own, shifting the original point of view and giving it new meaning. In 
                        Franklin's rendition of the song, she outright demands respect from her lover rather than asking and 
                        pleading for it—to acknowledge all that she gives and all that she does for him. Her arrangement also 
                        involved spelling out the letters of the word, using her powerful, empowering vocals to drive home the 
                        song's memorable fifth verse alongside her backup singers. This was when “Respect” became an anthem for 
                        not just the civil rights movement, but a symbol of women's empowerment, too, proclaiming to the world 
                        that women deserved respect—especially women of color. In her autobiography, Franklin described how her 
                        version of “Respect” became a symbol to those who needed it.

                            “It was the need of a nation, the need of the average man and woman in the street, the businessman, 
                            the mother, the fireman, the teacher — everyone wanted respect. It was also one of the battle cries 
                            of the civil rights movement. The song took on monumental significance.”

                        'Respect' was more than just a song—it was a representation of the tumultuous times that African 
                        Americans endured throughout their lives. Although the fight for equal and civil rights was still going 
                        strong, segregation was still rampant and unrelenting, attempting to drown out the voices of protestors. 
                        But as people began to waver or lose courage to continue fighting for an equal nation, then came Aretha 
                        Franklin, who shattered the records with her voice. The song was nothing short of a masterpiece, becoming 
                        a hit on multiple radio stations and dominating the Billboard Pop Singles and Black Singles chart.

                        While African Americans were struggling—being disrespected and killed over expressing their want for 
                        civil rights—Franklin's song extended a hand to her people and brought them back up to their feet. 
                        'Respect' became an anthem and a rallying cry for not just the civil rights movement, but a symbol of 
                        women's empowerment, too, proclaiming to the world that women deserve respect—especially women of color.
