                        Franklin was immersed in the civil rights movement for as long as she grew up with her father. She 
                        would express her support for the cause through multiple acts of service, such as providing funds 
                        for civil rights groups and performing at various protests. One of her most commendable acts during 
                        the civil rights movements was when she offered to post bail for Angela Davis, a prominent activist 
                        for civil rights who was jailed in 1970 after being accused of assisting in a courtroom siege that 
                        resulted in the deaths of four people and eluding the police.

                    <p>
                        At the time of her arrest, thousands of Americans across the nation began pushing for Davis' release 
                        from jail, attending rallies and protesting for her immediate release and freedom. Franklin also spoke 
                        up about Davis' imprisonment, declaring to the press that Davis deserves freedom, and that she would 
                        gladly pay for her bail, “whether it's $100,00 or $250,000.” While her father, who was committed to 
                        the civil rights movement, did not agree with her stance on the issue, Franklin told the press that 
                        although she still respects him and his ideals, she will nevertheless continue to stick to her beliefs 
                        and push for Davis' freedom.

                            “Angela Davis must go free. Black people will be free. I've been locked up (for disturbing the 
                            peace in Detroit) and I know you got to disturb the peace when you get no peace. Jail is hell to 
                            be in. I'm going to see her free if there is any justice in our courts, not because I believe in 
                            communism, but because she's a Black woman and she wants freedom for Black people. I have the 
                            money; I got it from Black people—they've made me financially able to have it—and I want to use 
                            it in ways that will help our people.”

                        Franklin often involved herself in the civil rights movement with her music and personal connections; 
                        her father was a close friend of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and she found herself working alongside 
                        King and other notable civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. Jackson told the press 
                        that when King was still alive, Franklin would help them make payroll; one of her most notable 
                        examples of doing so was when the group took an 11-city tour with Harry Belafonte, another singer and 
                        civil rights activist who is best known for popularizing calypso music in the 1950s-1960s. Together 
                        with Belafonte, Franklin performed 11 concerts for free during the tour and kickstarted a fundraiser 
                        for Jackson's campaign. Jackson acknowledged Aretha as more than just an entertainer—she was an 
                        inspiration and a socially conscious artist who “shared her points of view from the stage for 
                        challenged people, to register to vote, to stand up for decency.”

                    <h2>The Meaning of “Respect”</h2>
                    <div class="img-2">

                        Franklin's unwavering dedication and support for the civil rights movement extended far beyond her 
                        acts of good service and contributions to the community. Indeed, it would be impossible to talk about 
                        Aretha Franklin's involvement in the civil rights movement without mentioning her rendition of 
                        “Respect,” which is considered one of the most iconic and influential hits of her music career. The 
                        song was first recorded in 1965 by Otis Redding, an American singer and songwriter considered to be 
                        one of the most iconic soul men of his time. The original meaning of the song was about a hard-working 
                        man requesting “a little respect” from his lover once he returns home from work. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Franklin, who was around 25 at the time, would later come across the song in 1967 and decided to 
                        transform it into that of her own, shifting the original point of view and giving it new meaning. In 
                        Franklin's rendition of the song, she outright demands respect from her lover rather than asking and 
                        pleading for it—to acknowledge all that she gives and all that she does for him. Her arrangement also 
                        involved spelling out the letters of the word, using her powerful, empowering vocals to drive home 
                        the song's memorable fifth verse alongside her backup singers. This was when “Respect” became an anthem 
                        for not just the civil rights movement, but a symbol of women's empowerment, too, proclaiming to the 
                        world that women deserved respect—especially women of color. In her autobiography, Franklin described 
                        how her version of “Respect” became a symbol to those who needed it.

                            “It was the need of a nation, the need of the average man and woman in the street, the businessman, 
                            the mother, the fireman, the teacher — everyone wanted respect. It was also one of the battle cries 
                            of the civil rights movement. The song took on monumental significance.”

                        While African Americans were struggling—being disrespected and killed over expressing their want for 
                        civil rights—Franklin's song reached out to the people and brought them back up to their feet. 
                        'Respect' became an anthem and a rallying cry for not just the civil rights movement, but a symbol of 
                        women's empowerment, too, proclaiming to the world that women deserve respect—especially women of 
                        color. Not too long before 'Respect' was released to the public, Otis Redding visited the office of 
                        Jerry Wexler, who recorded the song with Aretha Franklin. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After giving the song a listen, Wexler told the press that in that moment, Redding benignly and 
                        ruefully said, “She done took my song.” Redding understood how much talent Franklin had and how she 
                        was able to express it in such a bold manner, knowing that the original identity of the song had 
                        slipped out of his grasp and into hers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        'Respect' was more than just a song—it was a representation of the tumultuous times that African 
                        Americans endured throughout their lives. Amidst the ongoing struggle for equal and civil rights, 
                        the unrelenting force of segregation sought to suppress the voices of protestors. But Aretha Franklin 
                        emerged as a beacon of resilience with a voice to unite the souls of hundreds of thousands of African 
                        Americans. And the world knew that the song was nothing short of a masterpiece, becoming a hit on 
                        multiple radio stations and dominating the Billboard Pop Singles and Black Singles chart.
