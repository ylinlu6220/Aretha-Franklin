                        Of course, the extent to which Aretha Franklin's voice revolutionized the world extended far beyond the 
                        reaches of the civil rights movement. 'Respect' transcended its role as an anthem for the civil rights 
                        movement; it emerged as a symbol of female empowerment, encapsulating the women's rights movements on 
                        a broader scale. Although Redding's initial recording of the song portrays the man as the pillar of the 
                        household, Franklin subverts the world's traditional gender norms by depicting the woman as the primary 
                        supporter of the household and her husband.

                        Another well-known song of Franklin's that also arose as a symbol of feminism and women's empowerment 
                        was 'Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves,' which commended and celebrated the independence of women 
                        around the world when it hit the charts in 1985. Described as a modern feminist anthem, the song 
                        encourages women to rise above the societal norms placed upon them—that they were equal and capable 
                        of just as much as the men of their society were. With Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart, Franklin's 
                        vocals once again took the world by storm and brought the song to greater heights as a feminist anthem. 
                        The song's second verse is recognized for its appreciation of women from all walks of life—mothers and 
                        daughters, woman to woman, every single one of them deserved the same opportunities and respect.
                    </p>
                    <div class="quoted">
                        <p>
                            “Now this is a song to celebrate the conscious liberation of the female state! Mothers, daughters, 
                            and their daughters, too. Woman to woman, we're singin' with you. The inferior sex got a new 
                            exterior—we got doctors, lawyers, politicians, too.”
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        'Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves' did far more than just empower women and remind them of their 
                        value, of course; it went on to remind people around the world that women brought an undeniable 
                        strength and determination to every sphere of life that should be acknowledged in a more inclusive and 
                        equitable society.

                            “They say that 'it's a man's world,' but you can't prove that by me. But as long as we're together 
                            baby, show some respect for me.”

                        Yet another song made famous as a result of Franklin's talent was 'Do Right Woman, Do Right Man,' 
                        written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn. A country song that calls for respect for the woman in a 
                        relationship, Moman and Penn worked on the lyrics for the song prior to Franklin's arrival to the scene 
                        with Wexler. When the two presented the finished draft, Penn recalls Wexler telling them that something 
                        was missing—a bridge. Penn and Moman returned to the studio to work out the bridge and figure out what 
                        was missing before Wexler's next evaluation. Penn started writing down “They say that it's a man's 
                        world,” and Wexler would soon follow up with “but you can't prove that by me.” But what was it missing? 
                        Neither of them could figure out what the bridge needed to complete the song and send it off for 
                        recording. That was when Franklin chimed in with a line of her own: “But as long as we're together baby, 
                        show some respect for me.” And with that, the bridge—and the entire song, by extension—was complete.

                    <p>
                        However, recording the song in 1967 proved to be difficult for all members involved on the team. During 
                        one of the sessions, Franklin's husband and manager at the time, Ted White, engaged in an altercation 
                        with the trumpeter, Ken Laxton. The argument started at Rick Hall's FAME Studios in Alabama; although 
                        Rick Hall later tried to explain things and act as a mediator, his attempt resulted in a fight between 
                        him and White. The next morning, Franklin had abruptly disappeared from Alabama, leaving the song 
                        unfinished. For weeks, Wexler attempted to get back in contact with Franklin until she later reappeared 
                        and agreed to record once more, albeit this time in New York City. She was back on track—this time, 
                        without Ted White at the scene—and after the first few sessions, 'Do Right Woman, Do Right Man' was 
                        ready to be released to the public. 
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Along with her sisters, Erma and Carolyn, Franklin sang her heart out for another masterpiece of a song 
                        that emphasizes the need for equality between men and women. Women were “flesh and blood, just like a 
                        man,” and deserved to be treated as equals alongside men. If no one knew how to effectively convey the 
                        need for equality and respect in an era where women were lacking respect, then Franklin had just the 
                        words—and the voice—to proudly declare the message for them. And the song was a hit, with Rolling Stone 
                        listing the song as number 476 in the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time the year it was released. You 
                        could argue that no other female singer was as dedicated to the cause for equality as Aretha Franklin, 
                        and you could see her determination and passion in the lyrics she wove into the song herself, and many 
                        more to come.
