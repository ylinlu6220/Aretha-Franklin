                        Aretha Franklin was born on March 25, 1942 in Memphis, Tennessee. As a child, Franklin’s relatives moved between Buffalo, New York and Detroit, Michigan. Although she spent most of her childhood in other states, above all else did Franklin consider Detroit her hometown, holding a special place in her heart. When Franklin was 10, she experienced the loss of her mother; as a result, she was raised and spent most of her life with her father, C.L. Franklin, a minister at a Baptist church and a civil rights activist who members of the community referred to as “the man with the million-dollar voice.” C.L. Franklin was no doubt a large influence on Aretha Franklin's life and future, playing a pivotal role in her upbringing as a musical artist.

                        Franklin’s father encouraged her to sing, going to great lengths to ensure that members of the church could see his daughter’s performance. During this time, she also learned how to play the piano without the aid of formal lessons. Still at the age of 10, Franklin began to see a future laid out in front of her—a career as a gospel singer. However, at the age of 12, Franklin became pregnant with her first son, Clarence, and two years later to another son, Edward. Despite these unexpected obstacles in her life, Franklin refused to let this change in her life stop her from pursuing her passion and goals. Her older sisters and grandmother helped her take care of her two sons, alleviating some of her stress while she continued to pursue a career in music. And at the age 14, Franklin released her first album, “Songs of Faith”. The album was recorded at the New Bethel Baptist Church, including nine tracks that featured Franklin as a singer and a pianist. It was an early look into what exactly she was capable of at such a young age.

                        As a teenager, Franklin would travel with her father on his various speaking tours as a member in the junior choir. During this time in her life, she was able to meet with and befriend other gospel singers such Clara Ward and Mahalia Jackson, who would later become memorable vocalists of the 20th century. During her travels, it is said that she came across Sam Cooke, who was a lead singer in a gospel group called the Soul Stirrers. Their meeting left an impression on Franklin—when Cooke later left his career as a gospel singer and transitioned to secular pop music, she felt a new bout of inspiration and started to consider a musical career where she could dive into different genres of music outside of her gospel singing. Her father, who was her manager at the time, sought out opportunities with larger record labels, believing she could excel and go even farther with her talent. Then, the turning point in Franklin’s life suddenly arose when John Hammond, an executive producer, invited her to New York for a live audition. And at just 18 years old, Aretha Franklin secured a contract with one of the most “prestigious of American record companies,” and she was ready to begin a new era of her life.
